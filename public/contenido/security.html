<FONT SIZE=4.6><p>In today’s complex and regulated environment, businesses need to focus on building
more secure solutions that deliver value to their customers, partners, and shareholders—both
in the cloud and on premises. I.M.Automation has decades-long experience building enterprise software
and running some of the largest online services in the world, and leverages this experience to implement
and continuously improve security-aware software development, operational management, and threat mitigation
practices that are essential to the strong protection of services and data.</p>
<p>The guiding principle of I.M.Automation’s security strategy is to “assume breach,” and I.M.Automation’s global 
incident response team works around the clock to mitigate the effects of any attack against the I.M.Automation business
cloud. Security is built into I.M.Automationt business products and cloud services from the ground up, starting with the
security Development Lifecycle, a mandatory development process that embeds security requirements into every phase of 
the development process. I.M.Automation complies with both international and industry-specific compliance standards and 
participates in rigorous third-party audits, which verify our security controls.</p></FONT>
